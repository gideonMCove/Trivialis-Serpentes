 Each question is multiple choice, with 4 possible answers. The answers will be shown on `<cards>`. Each question and its answers will written with `arrays`inside of `objects` inside of `arrays`, like so:

```javascript
Const questions = [
{
    question: "Which Snake doesn't have to mate to lay eggs?",
    answers: ["CopperHead", "Cobra", "Corn Snake"],
    correct: "Corn Snake"
}
{
    question: "What do snakes smell with?",
    answers: ["Their Nose", "Through Their Skin", "Their Tongue"],
    correct: "Their Tongue"
}
]
```
A `sort()` function will be used to shuffle the array before playing each round.

Try to score all ten out of ten!
